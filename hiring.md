# Hiring graduate students
I am currently hiring graduate students to join my lab at SFU in September 2022. If you want to push the boundary of computer vision with machine learning towards effective understanding of the 3D world, with applications to autonomous systems/robotics, inverse graphics, and augmented reality, please apply here â€“ application deadline is January 10, 2022!

## How to contact me
Please use andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca for inquiries about PhD graduate admissions (do not CC my Google or UofT emails, and I will disregard requests sent to other mailboxes). I check this mailbox during the weekend, and I reply to all messages. Further, if you want to be considered before submitting an official application to SFU, please have a senior researcher of reputable caliber direclty send me a few words about you / your potential as a researcher.

## Important note
as I have not yet officially joined SFU, you will not find my name in the application system. Instead, please select the graduate chair (Jiangchuan Liu) in the system as the (temporary) advisor, and mention my name as a note in your application.
